				<div class="legal-section">
					<h2>Service Agreement</h2>
					<p>These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your engagement with Enmanuel Yasell ("Designer") for UI/UX design services. By engaging the Designer's services, you agree to be bound by these Terms.</p>
				</div>

				<div class="legal-section">
					<h2>Project Scope & Timeline</h2>
					<p>Project scope, deliverables, timeline, and payment terms will be agreed upon in writing before work commences. Any changes to scope may result in additional charges and timeline adjustments.</p>
				</div>

				<div class="legal-section">
					<h2>Payment Terms</h2>
					<p>Payment is due according to the agreed schedule. Projects may be structured with milestone payments or full payment upon completion. Late payments may incur additional fees.</p>
				</div>

				<div class="legal-section">
					<h2>Project Cancellation & Refund Policy</h2>
					<p><strong>Cancellation after project commencement:</strong> If you cancel a project after work has begun, you will be liable for 50% of the total agreed project fee. This covers the work already completed and the opportunity cost of the engagement.</p>
					<p><strong>Example:</strong> If the total project fee is $2,000 and you cancel after 40% of the work is complete, you will owe $1,000 (50% of the total fee).</p>
					<p><strong>Cancellation before commencement:</strong> Projects may be cancelled without penalty before work begins, provided any initial deposits are refunded minus any administrative costs.</p>
				</div>

				<div class="legal-section">
					<h2>Intellectual Property</h2>
					<p>Until full payment is received, all design work, concepts, and deliverables remain the intellectual property of the Designer. Upon completion of payment, the client receives a license to use the delivered work for the agreed purposes.</p>
					<p>The Designer retains the right to showcase completed work in their portfolio and marketing materials, unless otherwise agreed in writing.</p>
				</div>

				<div class="legal-section">
					<h2>Revisions & Changes</h2>
					<p>A reasonable number of revisions (typically 2-3 rounds) are included in the project scope. Additional revisions may incur extra charges. Major scope changes will be treated as separate projects.</p>
				</div>

				<div class="legal-section">
					<h2>Client Responsibilities</h2>
					<p>Clients are expected to provide timely feedback, assets, and information necessary for project completion. Delays in client response may affect project timeline and may result in additional charges.</p>
				</div>

				<div class="legal-section">
					<h2>Confidentiality</h2>
					<p>Both parties agree to maintain confidentiality regarding project details, business information, and sensitive data shared during the engagement.</p>
				</div>

				<div class="legal-section">
					<h2>Liability & Warranties</h2>
					<p>Design services are provided with reasonable care and skill. The Designer makes no warranties regarding the suitability of designs for any particular purpose or outcome. The client assumes all risk for the use of delivered designs.</p>
				</div>

				<div class="legal-section">
					<h2>Dispute Resolution</h2>
					<p>Any disputes arising from these Terms will be resolved through mutual consultation and good faith negotiation. If resolution cannot be reached, disputes may be subject to mediation or arbitration as appropriate.</p>
